INCEPTION

Hypervisor: the software that controls the Virtual Machines, like Virtual Box.

Docker is a program that manages the life cycles of containers, edit them, run them, interact with them..

CONTAINERIZATION is the ability to create a lightweight environment where the processes can run on a host 
operating system… they share all the same things in that OS but they can not touch anything outside of 
their little bounded box.

Docker will pull images that are already known form the Docker Hub. 
For example if I do `docker run hello-world` docker replies in the terminal:
“Unable to find image ‘hello-world:latest’ locally
latest: Pulling form library/hello-world”

THE MAIN RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM:
From a docker file.  ——docker build——>.   docker image.  —-docker run———>  container

“While VMs simulate an entire machine, containers only contain an application.
“A container is an application that has been packaged with all the files, configurations 
and dependencies, necessary for it to run. “

Main disadvantage for the VM:
The containers share the underlying operating system between them. (While VMs can run 
with any OS, regardless of the OS of the host computer.”
… so if the operating system on that server crashes, all the containers will go down…

DOCKER COMPOSE is a tool for creating a multi-container application, where services can 
talk to one another easily and efficiently.
Docker compose, by default, will use a .env file to load variables.

Image name follows the pattern: `name:tag`

`volumes`: here we give the name of the volume that we want mounted into this container 
and then there is a colon and the path that this volume gets mounted to onto the container.
So whenever the container saves some data, like in a database, it actually gets saved to 
the volume we define here.



The Docker engine includes the Docker daemon, which is a background process that manages 
Docker containers, and the Docker client, which is a command-line tool that allows me to 
interact with the Docker daemon.

A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything 
needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, 
and runtime.

A DOCKER COMPOSE file is a YAML file that defines how multiple Docker containers should be 
set up and run. It allows you to define the services that make up your application, and then 
start and stop all of the containers with a single command.

Most-common dockers commands used:
docker build: Used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
docker run: Used to run a Docker container based on a Docker image.
docker pull: Used to pull a Docker image from a registry, such as Docker Hub.
docker push: Used to push a Docker image to a registry.
docker ps: Used to list the running Docker containers on a system.
docker stop: Used to stop a running Docker container.
docker rm: Used to remove a Docker container.
docker rmi: Used to remove a Docker image.
docker exec: Used to execute a command in a running Docker container.
docker logs: Used to view the logs for a Docker container.


Regarding the requirement of the subject: "Your NGINX container must be 
the only entrypoint into your infrastructure via the port 443 only, using 
the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 protocol."
----> in the docker-compose.yml, only the nginx service must have the ports section,
while the other two should only have the "expose" not "ports".

- NGINX should have the ports section to expose port 443 to the external 
	world (host machine). This makes it the only entry point into your 
	infrastructure, as required.
- All three services (NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB) should have the expose 
	section to make specific ports available to other containers within the 
	same Docker network. However, these ports will not be accessible 
	externally (outside the Docker network).
	-	NGINX exposes port 80 internally so it can communicate with WordPress.
	- 	WordPress exposes port 80 internally for communication with NGINX.
	-	MariaDB exposes port 3306 internally for WordPress to communicate with the database.

NAMED VOLUMES are managed by Docker and can persist 
data independently of the container lifecycle.

What happens in the case of my volumes, for example for the database volume:
1. 	All actions performed on `/var/lib/mysql` in the container are directly 
	applied to `/home/mevangel/data/database` on the host.
		- If the container writes a new file to `/var/lib/mysql`, that file 
		  will immediately appear in `/home/mevangel/data/database`.
		- If the container deletes a file from `/var/lib/mysql`, it is deleted
		  from `/home/mevangel/data/database`.
2. 	Files in `/home/mevangel/data/database` are accessible to the container
	at `/var/lib/mysql`.
		- When the container starts, any existing files in `/home/mevangel/data/
		  database` will be visible at `/var/lib/mysql` inside the container.
